        <span class="text-title">Background</span>
        <p class="text">
          ASES is a global collegiate entrepreneurship organization founded at Stanford University in 1998.  The founders of ASES recognized the growing opportunities to innovate in the East as well as the wealth of capital and resources the West had to provide and built ASES to connect entrepreneurs from these two sides of the world.  Since then, ASES has spread to over 12 different countries and holds significant prestige in the Asia-Pacific.

      <div class="text-container">
        <span class="text-title">The Problem</span>
        <p class="text">
          Despite its growing presence in the Asia-Pacific, ASESâ€™s brand at Stanford was becoming painfully outdated, hurting its recruitment efforts.  During the summer of 2014, the newly elected leadership decided to task me with rebranding the ASES organization.
          <br><br>
          Creating a new logo to replace the already recognized original was especially tricky since it would have to be adopted globally at each of the international ASES branches.
        </p>

      <div class="text-container">
        <span class="text-title">The New ASES</span>
        <p class="text">
          The original ASES logo was designed with the intention of conveying a connection between the East and the West through ASES.
          <br><br>
          However, since its founding, ASES has grown to become a much more global organization.  Today, ASES is composed of many branches that exist around the globe.  I wanted to design a modern symbol that represented this global cohesiveness and unity between the branches that make up the ASES organization.

          At the end of the summer, we launched the new logo with a video I filmed and edited as well as a series of blog posts.  Within a week, the new logo had successfully been adopted at the global ASES branches.

        <span class="text-title">A New Message</span>
        <p class="text">
          At Stanford there has arisen a divide between students: Fuzzies and Techies.  While many at Stanford associate entrepreneurship and startups with computer science and techies, ASES views entrepreneurship to be much more broad and interdisciplinary.  In our view, entrepreneurship was about solving problems in all fields and we wanted to communicate this message through our flyers to attract students of all backgrounds and majors.
          <br><br>
          Stanford only allows organizations to post flyers on specified bulletin boards that are often overcrowded with flyers constantly trying to grab your attention.  With this in mind, I wanted to use spacing to allow our message to popout.
