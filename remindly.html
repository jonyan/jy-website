    				The goal of CS 147: Intro to Human Computer Interaction is to learn and use design processes like needfinding, rapid prototyping and user testing to create well-designed mobile applications.
    				<br><br>
    				Over the course of 10 weeks, I went out and observed and conducted interviews with potential users, rapidly created and tested paper prototypes, and iterated with feedback I gathered through controlled online experiments (A/B testing, Google analytics etc) at scale.
    				<br><br>
    				Most importantly, I learned why these design principles and processes are essential to creating intuitive interfaces that are useful to people, bringing users joy rather than frustration.

    			<p class="text">
    				After a week spent observing and interviewing, one of the most common tasks we found people doing was setting simple individual and group reminders for deadlines, club meeting times etc.  As students, our schedules are constantly being poked and pulled to fit all the meetings, and deadlines that fill our lives.  In theory, technology posits itself to be a great tool to organize and solve the hassles of scheduling and reminders.  However, meetings are still missed and deadlines still pushed.
    				<br><br>
    				Digging deeper into why this was happening, we found that the majority of our interviewees used a calendar application to schedule their day; however they complained that the existing technologies are plagued by platform differences and for many simple tasks like reminders, are overkill.  Further, many viewed calendars as an application for events, not simple reminders that should perform their task when needed and disappear after.  Instead of crowding their already crowded calendars and going through the many steps of creating an event in a calendar application just to set a simple reminder, many students opted to just trust their memory; unsurprisingly, most of our interviewees admitted to forgetting to remind themselves or their friends.

    				Using our observations and interviews, we began brainstorming (note: limited to mobile applications). In order to achieve a platform independent solution, we opted to create a mobile web application.  At the very beginning, Remindly started off as a way to remind users of their forgotten passwords via text message.

    				After testing these prototypes and conducting more research we discovered existing solutions and decided to pivot.  Through these initial prototypes however, we realized how powerful SMS texts were.  Unlike many of our other mobile applications like email, LinkedIn, Facebook etc, our text message application was almost always at inbox/notification zero.  In a way, the text message application on our phones, regardless of platform or phone type is the phone’s primary notification hub, something everyone frequently checks.  This made it an ideal interface for receiving reminders.
    				<br><br>
  					We set out to design a solution that allowed you to set simple reminders for yourself and your friends through a mobile web application.  At the set time, a text message would be sent as the reminder directly to your phone.

    				After prototying and testing various interfaces and user flows, we observed that users found a linear flow to be the most intuitive.  Once logged in, we divided the process of creating a remindly into 3 steps: Who, When, and What.
