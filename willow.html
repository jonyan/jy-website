    			<p class="text">
    				At startup weekend, teams are formed on the first day of the event; anyone with an idea can pitch. Ideas are voted on and teams are formed around the most popular ones.  I joined what would later be called Willow Goes Chic.  We wanted to solve the buying a wedding dress experience.  Molly, a newly wed, and the member with the original idea, began her pitch by posing a question: “How many of you know what its like to buy a wedding dress?”  Unsurprisingly not a single hand was raised – the majority of the crowd was male, quite representative of the silicon valley and even the startup community more broadly.  This was a space that had been overlooked by technology and the startup community and was clearly in desperate need of it.
    				<br><br>	
  					Our team was composed of 4 Stanford MBA’s and 2 Undergraduate Stanford Hackers.

    			<p class="text">
    				From Molly’s personal experience and previous interview’s with over 50 individuals we gathered the following observations:
    				<ul>
  						<li>The wedding dress industry is steeped in anachronistic traditions.</li>
  						<li>Searching online for a boutique to shop from can be misleading – boutiques advertise which brands they carry, however inventory for dresses is not guaranteed.</li>
  						<li>Purchasing a wedding dress is almost a year-long process, requiring 4-6 months to schedule an appointment with a wedding boutique store, 6-8 months (and often times more) to get the dress made and in your hands.</li>
  						<li>Interviewees felt forced into the traditional system as a result of lack of alternatives: You either went to a traditional boutique, a long, frustrating experience dominated by pushy sales people and tug-of-wars at early morning sample sales, or you want to a David’s bridal, a low quality, unfashionable alternative.</li>
  						<li>Many interviewees were extremely frustrated with the process, complaining that they felt like there was always that one dress in the back of the storeroom that they weren’t seeing.  In a boutique store, the customer looks through a catalog book and can only select 5 dresses to see at a time, all the while with a pressuring sales person by your side resulting in a rushed, unpleasant experience.</li>
  						<li>At the time of this event, there does not exist a reliable, legitimate way to buy quality couture at affordable prices online.</li>
  					</ul>
  					With these observations, we begain brainstorming.

    			<span class="text-title">Brainstorming</span>
    			<p class="text">
    				We took inspiration from businesses like Warby Parker.  Just like how no one imagined fashionable, high quality eye wear could be sold online, we wanted to prove that consumers could buy boutique quality wedding dresses without the boutique markup, online.
    				<br><br>
  					Through our brainstorm, we came up with several features that we felt addressed potential misgivings about purchasing a wedding dress online.  Although consumers would be purchasing their dresses through the Internet, we wanted the experience to still be a special one.  We imagined including perks like a bottle of champage to accompany the wedding dress, or having a Willow Goes Chic certified seamstress be present during the try-on.  We also envisioned a portal where customers could choose to customize their dress and truly make it their own.

    			<span class="text-title">Our Vision: Willow Goes Chic</span>
    			<p class="text">
    				<span class="semi-bold">Chic, boutique wedding dresses, without the boutique markup.</span>
  					<br><br>
  					Willow Goes Chic represents the best of both worlds: traditional boutique service with the convenience, price, and speed of the internet. 
  					<br><br>
  					No more pushy salespeople and driving across town for that Tuesday afternoon appointment. No more tug-of-war at that early morning sample sale, while changing in your skivvies in front of strangers. Just one-of-a-kind, boutique quality dresses at unheard-of prices. 
  					<br><br>
  					Pick your dress from our tightly curated selection and consult our stylists to see what would suit your body and venue. Need to add a cap sleeve or shorten the train? No problem. Want to discuss with your family and friends? Use our virtual showroom. Then we ship your custom gown in 8 weeks, not 8 months, and recommend certified seamstresses near you to ensure your dress fits like a glove. After all, it’s your day.

    				As the designer, my task was to create a website that evoked a sense of elegance and couture but in a fun whimsical manner.  We didn’t want our browse page to look like your typical amazon ecommerce site with rows of items, a shopping cart encouraging you to keep shopping and buy buttons on every page optimized for you to make impulse purchases.  Instead, we wanted each dress to be unique and have a personality.

    				We recognize that buying a dress is just half the battle.  To get it wedding day ready, a bride has to go through several fittings.  Willow Goes Chic provides a full experience allowing customers to easily find certified seamstresses locally.
